# lnd-manageJ

## What can you do with lnd-manageJ?

Right now, nothing. Sorry. Work in progress.

## What is the purpose of lnd-manageJ?

In the far future, you can run lnd-manageJ in the background and constantly gather information from your
[lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) node.
This information is condensed and analyzed so that

 - you can see your node's and each peer's/channel's forwarding activity
 - you can understand each channel's/peer's forwarding characteristics (is it a sink? a source? bidirectional?)  
 - you can tweak the forwarding fees based on previous and forecasted routing activity

In short, lnd-manageJ helps you understand and manage the inner workings of your lnd node.

## How can I run lnd-manageJ?

Install Java 16 and run `./start.sh`.
